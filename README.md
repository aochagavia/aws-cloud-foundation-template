# Blackbird Cloud AWS Cloud Environment Template


[![blackbird-logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackbird-cloud/terraform-module-template/main/.config/logo_simple.png)](https://blackbird.cloud)

## Intro

We (Blackbird Cloud) have deployed many AWS cloud environment for our clients. We use this repository as a boilerplate for our cloud deployment.

This Repository includes:
* Account management
* Organization management
* GitHub OIDC Stack
* GitOps (GitHub Action) pipeline
* Stacksets for common resources in every accounts (TF State Bucket, GitHub Role, etc)

## How to deploy

1. Create AWS Account, make sure you note down the account name and account id
2. Go to `cloud/00-organization/terragrunt.hcl` and fill in your company detail
3. Deploy Both `stacks/github-oidc-provider.yaml` and `stacks/terraform-state.yaml` to CloudFormation
    * For github oidc provider stack fill in `SubjectClaimFilters` with the following format `repo:YOUR_ORGANIZATION/YOUR_REPO:ref:refs/heads/BRANCH_NAME` we advise to deploy use `main` as branch name. This is nessecary to make sure that only GitHub Actions that run on the main branch are allowed to plan and apply changes on AWS.
    * Once the terraform state stack is done note down the bucket name, it will be used as the state bucket for the next steps.
4. Create 2 variables on GitHub -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> Variables
    * `AWS_IAM_ROLE`: fill in `IAM Role ARN` created by github-oidc-provider stack
    * `AWS_REGION`: fill in the region where you created the CloudFormation Stacks on step 3
5. On `.github/workflows/aws_deployment.yml` update all occurences of `my-project-name` to your github project name.
6. On `cloud/global.hcl` enter all the information under `MANUAL STEP: Enter manually` block
7. On` cloud/management/terragrunt.hcl` enter all the information under `MANUAL STEP: Enter manually` block. Use the bucket name created by `stacks/terraform-state.yaml` for `bucket_name`
8. Create the users list on `cloud/management/02-iam-sso/01-users/terragrunt.hcl`, you can remove `john.doe@email.com`.
9. On `cloud/management/02-iam-sso/02-groups/terragrunt.hcl` enter the groups with the users you would like to create. Make sure to assign the users created by adding multiple `dependency.users.outputs.users["USER_EMAIL"].user_id` and replace `USER_EMAIL` with the actual email.
    * On initial run align the `mock_output` value of `dependency "users"` with `01-users`, make sure all emails registered `01-users` are `listed`. `user_id` value can be left `"user_id"`
10. (Optional) On `cloud/management/02-iam-sso/03-permission-sets/terragrunt.hcl` enter the permission-sets you would like to create. We've included our default permission sets that we use for common use cases
11. (Optional) On `cloud/management/02-iam-sso/04-account-assignment/terragrunt.hcl` assign accounts and permission-sets, to users and groups. The default value will deploy `AdministratorAccess` permission set along with attached users on all accounts.
12. Commit and push, it will trigger the pipeline to run
    * It will *fail* initially
13. Then there are a few steps to be taken before re-runing the pipeline
    * Go the management account, navigate to stackset then enable trusted access
    * Go to IAM identity center, and click on enable then Configure your IdP
14. Re-run the pipeline, and fingers crossed everything should run

## Troubleshoot

### Rate Limited
```
Error: enabling Security Hub Organization Admin Account (741117833771): LimitExceededException: AWS Organizations can't complete your request because another request is already in progress. Try again later.
```
If you see this error, it means we're beeing rate limited by AWS. Simply re-run the action to fix it


## Future improvements

[ ] Make Cloudformation bucket public with templates

[ ] Double check CI files and remove hardcodes

[ ] Add mock outputs to organization dependencies
